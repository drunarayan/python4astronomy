### Gaia Query and plotting half-a-million stars in Sun's immediate 200-parsec neighborhood

In this project you will learn how to do Gaia sattelite database queries and plot half-a-million stars in Sun's immediate 200-parsec neighborhood using Python.

*  how to write setup for doing database queries in python
*  how to query using Gaia sattelite API and receive a file with 500,000 rows of star data
*  how to create datframes and process that data
*  how to plot half-a-million stars in Sun's immediate 200-parsec neighborhood
*  marvel at the main sequence, white dwarfs, and super luminaries in our galaxy
