### Workshop repository for the ***Python for Astronomy 2022*** Course 
### taught for BRIEF Boyce Astro Foundation by Chandru Narayan

### Welcome to Python for Astronomy Course! 

Our course will cover a smattering of interesting or historically significant Astronomy topics in no particular sequence.  However, the main goal of this course is to really teach critical college and corporate skills that you will need as a professional. We will attempt to develop these skills primarily on Astronomy related topics as you clearly are astro enthusiasts!  The primary audience for this course are High School, College students, or Early Career professionals. 

Skills we will teach include:
1. Jupyter Notebooks (the backbone of Google colab)
1. JupyterHub & JupyterLab (dev environment for Jupyter Notebooks adopted widely by universities)
1. Markdown Syntax (dynamic text, images, video and code embedded publishing)
1. LaTeX (web and github enables equation editor for research)
1. Python (language of choice for data science and STEM publications)
1. Matplotlib (plotting large amounts of data)
1. Pandas & Numpy (dataframes and math libraries for Python)
1. SQL (structured query language for querying asto databases)

We expect to run for 5 or 6 sessions starting October 13th, 2022. Look for a Zoom meeting schedule links to be available in the next day or two. Please check this link below for ALL UPDATES.  I will try not to send emails or notifications for any updates.  All materials will show up on this link below.  So please bookmark it check it frequently.

You will be logging into JupyterHub for getting workshop materials and creating your own Juoyter Notebooks.  Your username is simply the word ```python``` followed by ```<your first name>``` you provided in your registration. For instance, my username would be ```pythonchandru```. The first time you will log in, create a password you make up yourself.  That will become your actual password for this JupyterHub - please try not to forget it.  If you do, please slack me, I will reset it.
