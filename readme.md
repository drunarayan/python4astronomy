## Course repository for the ***Python for Astronomy 2022*** Workshop 
### taught for BRIEF Boyce Astro Foundation by Chandru Narayan

## Welcome to Python for Astronomy Workshop! 
### *Workshop commences 8:00 PM Thursday, October 20th. See below for details*
Our workshop will cover a smattering of interesting or historically significant Astronomy topics in no particular sequence.  However, the main goal of this course is to teach critical college and research skills that you will need as a student & professional. We will attempt to develop these skills primarily on Astronomy related topics as you clearly are astro enthusiasts!  The primary audience for this course are High School, College students, or Early Career professionals. 

Skills we will teach include:
1. Jupyter Notebooks (the backbone of Google colab)
1. JupyterHub & JupyterLab (dev environment for Jupyter Notebooks adopted widely by universities)
1. Markdown Syntax (dynamic text, images, video and code embedded publishing)
1. LaTeX (web and github enables equation editor for research)
1. Python (language of choice for data science and STEM publications)
1. Matplotlib (plotting large amounts of data)
1. Pandas & Numpy (dataframes and math libraries for Python)
1. SQL (structured query language for querying astro databases)

We expect to run for 5 sessions starting every Thursday October 20th, 2022 with an optional 6th session on November 24th. Look for a Zoom meeting schedule links to be available at this page ahead of the workshop start date on Oct 20th. Please check this link below for ALL UPDATES.  I will try not to send emails or notifications for any updates.  All materials will show up on this link below.  So please bookmark it check it frequently.

## Your JupyterHub Account
You will be logging into JupyterHub for getting workshop materials and creating your own Jupyter Notebooks.  Your username is simply the word ```python``` followed by ```<your first name>``` you provided in your registration. For instance, my username would be ```pythonchandru```. The first time you will log in, create a password you make up yourself.  That will become your actual password for this JupyterHub - please try not to forget it.  If you do, [please slack](https://briefprograms.slack.com/archives/C037H58JUV6) or email me at pythonintro@gmail.com, I will reset it.

We will be using the Brief Programs Slack channel #python-intro for any questions you may have. Please look for this channel in the [Brief Programs Slack](https://briefprograms.slack.com/archives/C037H58JUV6)

## Workshop organization
The structure of this Workshop includes specific ***Projects*** below.  These Projects provide access to multiple materials, including Jupyter Notebooks, media files (images, video), presentations, PDF files, CSV files, database files and the like.  Each Project wil have its own collection of files linked below.  When you click on a link below, it will make your own initial copy to your JupyterHub account and allow you to edit and modify them.  As you modify them, ***JupyterLab*** (the IDE inside JupyterHub) will keep track of the modifications and you ***should never lose your edits***.  It is highly recommended that you ***do not change the names of the notebooks or files*** as they are being tracked and version controlled. You can always return to this page to access any specific project below where you can access your latest edits.  JupyterHub is widely used and state-of-the-art mechanism that universities use to manage Jupyter Notebooks and other course materials.  It is expected that future courses taught by me for BRIEF Programs will provide access to the same user account you are using now.
