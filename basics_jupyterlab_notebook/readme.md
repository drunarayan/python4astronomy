## A beginner's introduction to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

In this project you will get beginner's introduction to using JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks. For this course we created a JupyterHub virtual environment on Google Cloud where you will login to access course materials. These include inital version of Jupyter Notebooks, images, video, CSV files and other media which you will modify to create your own versions and publish them.

## JupyterLab ðŸ§ª

**JupyterLab** is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. It is the interface that you're looking at right now.  Right-Click and open a new window for instructions to follow along in this Jupyter Notebook.

[Getting started with JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)

> **See Also**: For a more in-depth tour of Jupyter Notebooks and the Classic Jupyter Notebook interface, see [the Jupyter Notebook IPython tutorial on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/HEAD?urlpath=tree/binder/Index.ipynb).

## Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““

**Jupyter Notebooks** are a community standard for communicating and performing interactive computing. They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.

JupyterLab is one interface used to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks. Right-Click and open a new window for instructions to follow along in this Jupyter Notebook.

Please complete the folowing steps in Sequence to open and modify your first Jupyter Notebooks

1. [Right-Click to Open in New Window on this link and Log in to JupyterHub with your assigned username](https://bushastrolab.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrunarayan%2Fpython4astronomy&branch=gh-pages&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fpython4astronomy%2Fbasics_jupyterlab_notebook). This should open your own Jupyter Notebook 'Intro.ipynb' in the JupyterLab IDE.

2. Double Click on the Jupyter Notebook â€˜Intro.ipynbâ€™ on the left panel. Execute each cell by pressing Shift-Enter on your keyboard

3. Do the same for the other Jupyter Notebook â€˜Lorenz.ipynbâ€™ to do more advanced examples.
