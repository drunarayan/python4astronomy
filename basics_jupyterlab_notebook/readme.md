## A beginner's introduction to JupyterHub, JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

In this project you will get beginner's introduction to using JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks. For this course we created a JupyterHub virtual environment on Google Cloud where you will login to access course materials. These include inital version of Jupyter Notebooks, images, video, CSV files and other media which you will modify to create your own versions and publish them.

## JupyterHub ðŸ§ª

**JupyterHub** is a virtual environment on Google Cloud where you will login to access course materials and the server where your Jupyter Notebooks are hosted. This server is tuned for availability during daytime hours at each time zone that our participants access this course.

## JupyterLab ðŸ§ª

**JupyterLab** is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. It is the interface that you're looking at right now.  

### [Getting started with JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)

## Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““

**Jupyter Notebooks** are a community standard for communicating and performing interactive computing. They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.

JupyterLab is one interface used to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks. Right-Click and open a new window for instructions to follow along in this Jupyter Notebook.

Please complete the folowing steps in Sequence to open and modify your first Jupyter Notebooks

1. [Right-Click to Open in New Window on this link and Log in to JupyterHub with your assigned username](http://bushastrolab.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrunarayan%2Fpython4astronomy&branch=gh-pages&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fpython4astronomy%2Fbasics_jupyterlab_notebook%2Fintro_to_jupyter.ipynb?reset). This should open your own Jupyter Notebook 'intro_to_jupyter.ipynb' in the JupyterLab IDE.

2. Read instructions and execute each cell by pressing Shift-Enter on your keyboard

3. You click to double-click to open and do the same for the other Jupyter Notebooks 'Intro.ipynb' and â€˜Lorenz.ipynbâ€™ from the panel on your left to do more advanced examples.
