## A beginner's introduction to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

In this project you will get beginner's introduction to using JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks. For this course we created a JupyterHub virtual environment on Google Cloud where you will login to access course materials. These include inital version of Jupyter Notebooks, images, video, CSV files and other media which you will modify to create your own versions and publish them.

### JupyterLab ðŸ§ª

**JupyterLab** is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. JupyterLab is one interface used to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks.

### Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““

**Jupyter Notebooks** are a community standard for communicating and performing interactive computing. They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.
